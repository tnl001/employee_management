# About
I created this project as a way to familiarize myself with using a database in desktop applications. Used Java for GUI and H2 as the embeded database system.
# How to use
Download and run either the EmployeeMgt.exe or employee_management.jar file. NOTE: In order to run the jar file, you need to have Java version 13 or later installed.
